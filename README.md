   Development and testing of graphics routines in Java™ using Eclipse and JUnit.  
   - Focus: Test Driven Development, Unit Testing (JUnit4), Continuous Integration  
   - Tasks included debugging and completing implementations of shape classes (Point, Rectangle, Circle, RegularPolygon), writing unit tests, and adding a new RegularPolygon class.  

2. **Lab Coursework (COMP285/COMP220, 2024)**  
   Implementation of a `DateCalculator` class and automated tests.  
   - Tools: Ant build scripts, JUnit testing framework  
   - Deliverables: Ant build file, automated JUnit test cases (`DateCalculatorTest.java`), and structured build directories with XML/HTML reports.  
   - Focus: Automated Testing, Ant scripting, edge case testing, exception handling.  

**Module Information:**  
- Code: COMP285  
- Credits: 7.5
